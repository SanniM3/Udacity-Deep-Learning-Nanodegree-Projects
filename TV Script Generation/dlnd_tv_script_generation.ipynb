    "**Answer:** I initially tried (sequence_length,batch size) combination of (100, 128) and (100, 64). I assummed a sequence length of 100 was long enough to extract context and short enough to ease computation. These values were with an embedding dimension of int(vocab_size ** 0.25), a formula which I later discovered was for only the skip-gram model. These combinations gave me a minimum loss of 5.42. Then, I decided to use an embedding dimension of 500 (similar to the table comparing embedding dimensions given in the classroom) still with a sequence length and batch size of 100 and 64 respectively and this gave me a minimum loss of 2.71 after 20 epochs. However, I noticed the loss was still decreasing and the format of the script I generated with this model was a bit off, so I increased the number of epochs to 30 which achieved a training loss of 1.78. At the start of setting the hyperparameters, I used 512 hidden dimension and 3 layers lstm (ensuring a lot of feature extraction)just to see how long it takes to train for 10 epochs. Since it didn't take a long period of time and I was already achieving a trainig loss less than 3.5(the maximum loss on the project rubic), I stuck with those values as I increased number of epochs."
